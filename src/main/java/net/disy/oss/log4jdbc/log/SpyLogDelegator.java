/**
 * Delegates Spy events to a logger.
 * This interface is used for all logging activity used by log4jdbc and hides the specific implementation
 * of any given logging system from log4jdbc.
 * <p>
 * Modifications for log4j2:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Modification of the signature of the method <code>connectionOpened(Spy)</code> into
 * <code>connectionOpened(Spy, long)</code>, to accept a parameter <code>execTime</code>,
 * defining the time elapsed to open the connection in ms.
 * This information can be generated when a <code>ConnectionSpy</code> has been acquired
 * through the use of <code>DriverSpy</code> (through a <code>DriverManager</code>),
 * see <code>DriverSpy#connect(String, Properties)</code>.
 * It cannot be generated when a <code>ConnectionSpy</code> has been directly instantiated
 * (by providing an already instantiated <code>Connection</code> to the constructor
 * <code>ConnectionSpy(Connection)</code>; Nevertheless, new constructors for <code>ConnectionSpy</code>,
 * accepting the execution time to open the connection, can be used).
 * <li>Modification of the signature of the method <code>connectionClosed(Spy)</code> into
 * <code>connectionClosed(Spy, long)</code>, to accept a parameter <code>execTime</code>,
 * defining the time elapsed to close the connection in ms.
 * This execution time can always be computed by <code>ConnectionSpy#close()</code>.
 * <li><code>Slf4jSpyLogDelegator</code> has been modified accordingly.
 * </ul>
